## HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions ##

## Links ##

- Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

- Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## CCS Layout ##

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs. X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. X You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects ##

- Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

    - In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

    - In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

    - In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
