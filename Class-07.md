# Read 07 - Tables and Functions, Methods, Objects #

## Tables ##

The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page. 

A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element. 

Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header). 

You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. 

For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>. 


## Functions, Methods, Objects ##

The function statement declares a function.

A declared function is "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called).

In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they have both properties and methods.
