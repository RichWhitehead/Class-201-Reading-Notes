## JS Control Flow ##
  
* For Loops - A for loop enables a particular set of conditions to be executed repeatedly until a condition is satisfied. Imagine a situation where you would have to print numbers from 1 to 100. What would you do? Will you type in the printf command a hundred times or try to copy/paste it? This simple task would take an eternity. Using a for loop you can perform this action in three statements. This is the most basic example of the for loop. It can also be used in many advanced scenarios depending on the problem statement.

* While Loops - A while loop is one of the most common types of loop. The main characteristic of a while loop is that it will repeat a set of instructions based on a condition. As far as the loop returns a boolean value of TRUE, the code inside it will keep repeating. We use this kind of loop when we don't know the exact number of times a code needs to be executed.
