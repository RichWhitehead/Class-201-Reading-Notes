Charts are used to display data visually and it’s far better than tables. You can draw line charts, Pie charts, bar charts to make you site look substantially better.

The <canvas> element is looks like an image <img> element but doesn’t have the src and alt attributes and is used in the HTML element.

You can draw shapes, make grids, apply styles and colors to make you chart look professional as well as draw text.
