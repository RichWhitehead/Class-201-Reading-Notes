## HTML Images; CSS Color & Text ##

## Images ## 

In order to put a simple image on a webpage, we use the <img> element. This is an empty element (meaning that it has no text content or closing tag) that requires a minimum of one attribute to be useful â€” src (sometimes spoken as its full title, source). The src attribute contains a path pointing to the image you want to embed in the page, which can be a relative or absolute URL, in the same way as href attribute values in <a> elements.

## CSS Color ##

 - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
 - Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
 - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
 - Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
 - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

 ## Text ##

 -  Text is the backbone of any web page. It plays an double role; it provides content for you to enjoy as they skim through articles and articles of information, but it also gives Search Engines and Spiders keywords and meta data. 

 -  There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
 -  There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
 -  If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
 -  You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
 -  You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
