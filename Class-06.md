# Read 06 - JS Object Literals and The DOM #

## JS Object Literals ##

Object Literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

## The DOM ##

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML (Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.


DOM is a way to represent the webpage in the structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes or Elements using commands or methods provided by Document object.
