## The Past, Present and Future of Locak Storage for Web Applications ##

## What is local storage?

LocalStorage is a type of web storage that allows Javascript websites and apps to store and access data right in the browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window has been closed.

## Some advantages of local storage

Speed is one of the main advantages to local storage. Storing data on external hard drives is faster than uploading to the cloud. You also have full control of your backups, which means better control of who accesses your data. Disconnecting the drives from the network makes your data safe from attacks.
